# Express.js: Missing Error Handling in Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling in route handlers that interact with databases or external services.

The `bug.js` file shows an example of a route handler that does not properly handle errors during database lookups.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and poor user experience.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the route handler, showing best practices for error handling in Express.js.

## How to Reproduce the Bug

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the application: `node bug.js`
4. Access a valid user ID in your browser using the route `/users/:id`.
5. Access an invalid user ID (for example, `/users/invalid-id`).
6. Observe the error response (or lack thereof) in your browser's console or network tab.
